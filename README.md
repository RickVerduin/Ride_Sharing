# Ride Sharing by City Type

## Overview
This analysis takes a look at trends for ride sharing service PyBer. The data for this analysis consists of two seperate data sheets. The first is a list of 119 cities with their respective number of drivers, and whether they are considered "urban", "suburban", or "rural". The second sheet contains data about dates and fares for 2374 rides in these cities.

## Results
Cities in the urban category have by far the highest number of rides and drivers, and are responsible for 62.7% of the total fare amount. However, the amount of the average fare, as well as the average fare per driver are lower than the suburban and rural cities. Rural cities, while having the lowest number of rides and drivers, have the highest average fares, both per ride, and per driver. Suburban cities fall in between urban and rural cities for all these variables.

## Summary
The analysis suggests differences in supply and demand between rural, suburban, and urban areas. In order to increase performance of rural and suburban areas, supply and demand can be tweeked. The following recommendations should be considered:
- Increase the number of drivers in suburban and rural areas. It is possible that the number of rides is low in these areas, because there are not enough drivers available. Stimulating drivers to work in rural and suburban areas, rather than urban areas, might proof to be beneficial.
- Lower base fare prices in suburban and rural areas. Lower prices will lead to increased demand for ride sharing. It may be too expensive for people right now.
- Advertise ride sharing in suburban and rural areas. Focusing marketing strategies on creating awareness of ride sharing options will increase demand for these services.
